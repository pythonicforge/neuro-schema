#  Neuro-Schema

Neuro-Schema is an experimental framework for building **self-learning, self-evolving AI agents** with a soul-like structure.

Inspired by cognitive architectures and modular intelligence, this system fuses the following key components:

- **Core Identity Matrix** — defines the agent’s personality, values, and core constraints.
- **Memory System** — captures and organizes lived experiences as events.
- **Behavioral Policy Engine** — decides how the agent acts, rooted in identity and memory.
- **Self-Evolution Layer** — enables safe, sandboxed code/config updates during "rest cycles".
- **Metacognition Module** — allows the agent to reflect on its own performance and guide self-improvement.

## What This Is

A playground for:

- Building toy agents with personality and memory.
- Experimenting with self-modifying architectures.
- Designing sandboxed safety layers and guardrails.
- Embedding reasoning and introspection into agents.
- Running nightly rest cycles for personalization & learning.

## Vision

Think of this like the “React.js for self-learning AI.”

Just like React helped developers build reactive UIs by abstracting the hard parts, **Neuro-Schema is meant to give you a structured, modular baseline for building AI agents that evolve over time** — safely, intentionally, and transparently.

This is the beginning of a framework where:

> _“An agent doesn't just respond… it grows.”_

## Current Status

- [x] **Prototype phase** — core modules being scaffolded and stubbed.  
- [ ] First working agent loop with Identity, Memory, and basic Policy is live. (coming soon)

<br/>

## Why This Matters

We’re entering a world of personalized AI. But most systems today are static, fragile, and unreflective.

**Neuro-Schema is an effort to imagine what comes next**:  
Agents that can remember, reflect, evolve, and stay grounded in their values — like digital minds with their own inner compass.
